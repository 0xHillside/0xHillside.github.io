# Active Directory my beloved...

\
\
### Context
The purpose of this post honestly was because as of recently I have had questioned be asked from my friends
as to how I am as fast as I am with active directory, I didnt have the answers until I sat down and though about it.
Just like everything else in cyber security it comes with practice, experience and having a solid methodology...

Although there is 1 thing I noticed that makes solving active directory different from most methodologies when it comes to like
linux and windows, ofcourse its a given it would be different. we are talking about different technologies here but this is different.

When approaching linux, its a case of having a checklist, seeing what you have and exploiting it, the same applies to windows.
but... with active directory its a case of **everything** is infront of you already so which is the **right** choice?

Simple, there isnt ever a **right** choice. there is the **better** choice never **the** choice. whenever it comes to active directory there is always multiple ways to reach your final destination. 

An example would be a child domain -> parent domain attack, lets say you pwned dev.tech.local and you wanna pwn
