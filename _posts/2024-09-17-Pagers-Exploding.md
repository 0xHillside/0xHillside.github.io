### A simple investigation
\
On this day some new had broken out, hezbollah members had been targetted by an israeli
attack in which caused their pagers to suddenly and randomly "explode" as they are in the posession of its members, many vidoes
are circulating on the internet as of right now

### DISCLAIMER
**I am NOT** a chemist or in any way **knowledgable** interms of electronics, 
this post was made by using purely research and some critical thinking to show how e
asy disinformation campagins can go. I would like to add I do not **ASSOCIATE** nor am I
**related** to any **military group** or **bias**, my opinions are my own and im calling bullshit on 
israels claims interms of technical shit and proving this was **NOT** a cyber attack, if it was well...
May god help us all.



#### Very useful side note
side note:
\
This post basically re-affirms my blog with jake williams the previous head of Research & Development in the United states NSA saying "these explosions aren't just battires", ill still post it eitherway because im bored and its annoying seeing people fall for propaganda and fear mongering\
https://www.wired.com/story/pager-explosion-hezbollah/



## What are these pagers and why is hezbollah using them?
A pager is a small device you carry around that works like a personal radio.
When someone wants to send you a message, they dial a special number linked to your pager. 
The message gets sent out through radio waves to lots of pagers at once, but only your pager, 
with your specific code, picks up and shows the message. Your pager might beep or vibrate to 
let you know the message has arrived, and it will display the message on a small screen. Inside, 
the pager has a battery, a screen, and a little motor that vibrates when you get a message.
It's like a simple phone that only receives messages, and the battery lasts a long long time.

Hezbollah is essentially cutting the cord on using cellphones because it is a "Safer" method to
basically call for emergencies, whether it is OPSEC safe or not, you be the judge.

As you can see these batteries on point 7 are PRETTTYYYYYY small compared to the one that had
overheated above in the blog.





### Goods
The advantages of pagers could be useful for
Hezbollah members or any group operating in challenging environments. 
The long range of pagers allows members to communicate effectively in remote or mountainous 
areas, where cellphone signals may be weak or unavailable, ensuring reliable contact during 
operations. Fast message delivery ensures quick communication without delays, which is cruc
ial during urgent situations. Additionally, the fact that pagers don't have transmitters ma
kes them less likely to interfere with sensitive equipment and less detectable by surveillan
ce systems, potentially helping them maintain a lower profile compared to using cellphones, 
which can be tracked more easily.




### Bads


Given the disadvantages, pagers become mostly useful for emergency
meetings or situations where immediate response isn’t required. The one-way comm
unication limits their ability to coordinate in real time, and the lack of message de
livery confirmation means members might miss critical information if they’re out of range
or their pager is off. The need to resend messages repeatedly makes pagers less reliable for 
ongoing communication. However, for broadcasting emergency meeting alerts, pagers still ser
ve a purpose, as they can quickly reach members even in remote areas, ensuring they receive
the message when it's critical to gather without needing an immediate reply.




## What are lithium ion batteries and how are they involved?
Lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable and used in many devices like phones and laptops. 
They work by moving tiny particles called lithium ions between two parts inside the battery
when it's charging and discharging. When you charge the battery, the ions move from one side 
to the other and store energy. When you use the battery, the ions move back, releasing energy
to power your device. Unlike older batteries, lithium-ion batteries can be recharged many times 
and don’t need to be fully emptied before charging again. They are lighter and store more energy t
han other types of batteries, but they also have safety features to prevent overheating or fires.




### Goods 
Lithium-ion batteries have several advantages. 
They are more reliable than older batteries and don’t need to be fully drained before recharging. 
They’re also lighter and can store more energy compared to other rechargeable batteries. Since they 
don’t contain toxic materials like some older batteries, they’re better for the environment. Over time, 
they’ve improved, especially in electric cars like Tesla, where newer batteries can store more energy,
last longer, and give cars a longer driving range before needing a recharge.


### Bads
Lithium-ion batteries have a few disadvantages. They store less energy than gasoline,
so electric cars take longer to charge compared to refueling a gas car. There are also safety concerns 
because these batteries can overheat, catch fire, or even explode if overcharged or damaged, though safety 
features help prevent this. Sometimes, gases build up inside the battery, causing it to swell,
which can lead to failure. While these fires have gotten attention, gasoline cars actually catch fire
more often. Researchers are working on safer materials to reduce these risks in the future.


### Overheating conditions?

If a lithium-ion battery overheats,
the normal movement of ions inside it gets disrupted, which can cause the battery to get even hotter.
This can happen if the battery is overcharged, damaged, or short-circuited. As the temperature rises, 
the heat causes more instability, leading to a dangerous cycle where the battery gets hotter and may
eventually catch fire or explode if the safety features don’t stop it in time.

# Intermission
Now that the pagers are out of the way lets move on to the next topic at hand, muh fucken CYBERSECURITY.

## are we in the Cyber Punk future ?
While there are research papers from the University of florida documenting the usage of "voltage noise" to manipulate wireless charger 
and even making phones overheat its still not effective enough to send a "HACK" simply because 
to overload certain wireless devices like phones and even making FOB's explode But...

This is **after** modifying the ALREADY hardware built **thermal protection**

## So can israel do this to phones too?

even if this IS a cyber attack (spoiler alert its not), all of this electromagnetic and cybersecurity fearmongering can be EASILY 
disuaded with 1 simple factor as to why these pagers cant explode. Energy.

Look at the cases in which phone batteries explode like the samsung note 7 which had 
MANY instances of which it was "exploding" (in reality catching fire)
, the most minimal of research into said battery can show that these batteries are EASILY over 
3500~ mAh so it makes sense how they have that potential to be scary and hurt poeple

What about the pagers?

these pagers are a MEASILY 300~ mAh, 
pagers are relatively a low energy tool that do NOT need that much energy to function and somehow you want me to believe they can 
"explode" the same way they do in those videos
like bombs?, this is what a lithium battery for a phone looks like usually when it overheats, focus on the keyword. **overheats**

\
So now you can see how suspicious it is that even a phone's battery that overheats and fails does not **explode** in the same way those pagers did

# Conclusion

So what now? the simple answer to this problem is no, it is NOT a cyber attack that I can say with 100% confidence and im sure
other security professionals can say the same and/or already have. The conditions for an attack like this are extremely difficult to achieve and
would most likely be an edge case scenario that would DEFINITELY **NOT** cause this. furtheremore if this where the case then we would
be seeing much MUCH more highly political individuals getting respawned this specific way.

# So what is it? (My humble opinion)

I really dont know, what really came to mind and what makes the most sense as of now is that it could be a combination of techniques. Namely 
Frequency overloading in combination with maybe a tampered battery that causes overheating and a massive BOOM OR... 
It could be as simple as a wrapped plastic explosive hidden in the case of the pager and triggered by some israeli cell maybe? who knows
its too early to tell and not much information has come out yet
