### A simple investigation
\
On this day some new had broken out, hezbollah members had been targetted by an israeli
attack in which caused their pagers to suddenly and randomly "explode" as they are in the posession of its members, many vidoes
are circulating on the internet as of right now

### DISCLAIMER this post was being written before this post
**I am NOT** a chemist or in any way **knowledgable** interms of electronics, 
this post was made by using purely research and some critical thinking to show how e
asy disinformation campagins can go. I would like to add I do not **ASSOCIATE** nor am I
**related** to any **military group** or **bias**, my opinions are my own and im calling bullshit on 
israels claims interms of technical shit and proving this was **NOT** a cyber attack, if it was well...
May god help us all.

side note:
\
This post basically re-affirms my blog with jake williams the previous head of Research & Development in the United states NSA saying "these explosions aren't just battires", ill still post it eitherway because im bored and its annoying seeing people fall for propaganda and fear mongering\
https://www.wired.com/story/pager-explosion-hezbollah/



## What are these pagers and why is hezbollah using them?
A pager is a small device you carry around that works like a personal radio.
When someone wants to send you a message, they dial a special number linked to your pager. 
The message gets sent out through radio waves to lots of pagers at once, but only your pager, 
with your specific code, picks up and shows the message. Your pager might beep or vibrate to 
let you know the message has arrived, and it will display the message on a small screen. Inside, 
the pager has a battery, a screen, and a little motor that vibrates when you get a message.
It's like a simple phone that only receives messages, and the battery lasts a long long time.

Hezbollah is essentially cutting the cord on using cellphones because it is a "Safer" method to
basically call for emergencies, whether it is OPSEC safe or not, you be the judge.

### Insides of a pager

As you can see these batteries on point 7 are PRETTTYYYYYY small compared to the one that had
overheated above in the blog.





### Goods
The advantages of pagers could be useful for
Hezbollah members or any group operating in challenging environments. 
The long range of pagers allows members to communicate effectively in remote or mountainous 
areas, where cellphone signals may be weak or unavailable, ensuring reliable contact during 
operations. Fast message delivery ensures quick communication without delays, which is cruc
ial during urgent situations. Additionally, the fact that pagers don't have transmitters ma
kes them less likely to interfere with sensitive equipment and less detectable by surveillan
ce systems, potentially helping them maintain a lower profile compared to using cellphones, 
which can be tracked more easily.




### Bads


Given the disadvantages, pagers become mostly useful for emergency
meetings or situations where immediate response isn’t required. The one-way comm
unication limits their ability to coordinate in real time, and the lack of message de
livery confirmation means members might miss critical information if they’re out of range
or their pager is off. The need to resend messages repeatedly makes pagers less reliable for 
ongoing communication. However, for broadcasting emergency meeting alerts, pagers still ser
ve a purpose, as they can quickly reach members even in remote areas, ensuring they receive
the message when it's critical to gather without needing an immediate reply.




## Intermission
Now that the pagers are out of the way, lets move on to the next topic at hand. muh fucken BATTERIES





## What are lithium ion batteries and how are they involved?
Lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable and used in many devices like phones and laptops. 
They work by moving tiny particles called lithium ions between two parts inside the battery
when it's charging and discharging. When you charge the battery, the ions move from one side 
to the other and store energy. When you use the battery, the ions move back, releasing energy
to power your device. Unlike older batteries, lithium-ion batteries can be recharged many times 
and don’t need to be fully emptied before charging again. They are lighter and store more energy t
han other types of batteries, but they also have safety features to prevent overheating or fires.




### Goods 
Lithium-ion batteries have several advantages. 
They are more reliable than older batteries and don’t need to be fully drained before recharging. 
They’re also lighter and can store more energy compared to other rechargeable batteries. Since they 
don’t contain toxic materials like some older batteries, they’re better for the environment. Over time, 
they’ve improved, especially in electric cars like Tesla, where newer batteries can store more energy,
last longer, and give cars a longer driving range before needing a recharge.


### Bads
Lithium-ion batteries have a few disadvantages. They store less energy than gasoline,
so electric cars take longer to charge compared to refueling a gas car. There are also safety concerns 
because these batteries can overheat, catch fire, or even explode if overcharged or damaged, though safety 
features help prevent this. Sometimes, gases build up inside the battery, causing it to swell,
which can lead to failure. While these fires have gotten attention, gasoline cars actually catch fire
more often. Researchers are working on safer materials to reduce these risks in the future.


### Overheating conditions?

If a lithium-ion battery overheats,
the normal movement of ions inside it gets disrupted, which can cause the battery to get even hotter.
This can happen if the battery is overcharged, damaged, or short-circuited. As the temperature rises, 
the heat causes more instability, leading to a dangerous cycle where the battery gets hotter and may
eventually catch fire or explode if the safety features don’t stop it in time.

## So israel did use a cyber attack?

Wrong, all of this electromagnetic and cybersecurity fearmongering can be EASILY disuaded with 1 simple factor. Energy.

Look at the cases in which phone batteries explode, the most minimal of research into said battery can show that these batteries are EASILY over 
2500~ mAh so it makes sense how they have that potential.

What about the pagers?

these pagers are a MEASILY 300~ mAh, 
pagers are relatively a low energy tool that do NOT need that much energy to function and somehow they explode
like bombs?, this is what a lithium battery looks like usually when it overheats, focus on the keyword. **overheats**

# Conclusion
So what does that mean? it means that there is no way in ANY WORLD that this would be the case where it was a 
cyber attack or else everyone would have had a virus by now that caused their PC to explode mr.robot style
what is it? I really dont know, it could be frequency overloading in combination with maybe a tampered
battery that causes overheating and a massive BOOM OR... anything else really. its too early to tell


Final note:

If you disagree with me then you are completely justified to,
everyone has their opinions and this was simply me stating out mine.
If you want to have a conversation, disagree or have anything that might help reach to the _actual_
truth of what had occured. please do contact me at saif.yas@hotmail.com and I will update this blog
with every new piece of truth that comes out
